### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Public repositories and topics that might be of interest to you:  
## [:heavy_check_mark: **PHP Internal function mocker**](https://github.com/idimsh/php-internals-mocker)
A funny util that helps mocking calls to resources calls in unit tests.

## [:radioactive: **PHP Docker Image on mod_php**](https://github.com/idimsh/mphp7s)
A *really heavy* docker image with multiple PHP versions and with both Nginx and Apache2 to serve PHP. A working idea for Nginx serving static files and Apache serves the PHP files via mod_php which is for me preferred over PHP-FPM.  
It needs refinement and reduction of the size.

#### ðŸ’¬ beside that, you can ask me about PHP topics, get in touch via GitHub ... thanks and hope to see you in code :wink:
